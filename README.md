## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bharatlingo
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to configure Supabase and optional AI services:
```env
# Supabase Authentication & Database
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Optional AI Services
PORT=5000
INDICTRANS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
INDICCONFORMER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001
TTS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8002
```

### Supabase Database Setup
1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Open the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard.
3. Paste and run the contents of [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql).
4. Copy your project URL and anon public key into `.env`.
*(If Supabase keys are not set, LangLearn automatically operates in local offline mode using browser storage).*

### Adding New Languages

1. Add language to `src/data/languages.js`
2. Create lesson data in `src/data/lessons/[language].js`
3. Create assessment questions in `src/data/questions/[language].js`
4. Update imports in index files

### Adding New Lesson Types

1. Add exercise type to lesson data structure
2. Implement rendering logic in `src/pages/Lesson/Lesson.jsx`
3. Add validation/scoring logic

## Data Persistence

User data is stored in localStorage:
- User profile and preferences
- Learning progress
- Vocabulary mastery
- Achievements
- Streak data

Future versions may support PostgreSQL, Supabase, or Firebase migration.

## Security

- No API keys in frontend code
- `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- Password hashing for production auth
- Input validation
- XSS prevention

## Performance

- Lazy loading for large components
- Optimized animations with Framer Motion
- Efficient state management
- Minimal bundle size

## Testing

Test the following flows:
1. Authentication (signup, login, validation)
2. Onboarding (language selection, goals)
3. Assessment (all question types, scoring)
4. Lessons (all exercise types, XP, hearts)
5. Dashboard (stats, navigation)
6. Practice (vocabulary review)
7. Settings (all controls work)
8. Mobile responsiveness (320px, 375px, 768px)

## Troubleshooting

**Frontend not loading:**
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Check that port 5173 is available

**Backend not starting:**
- Check that port 5000 is available
- Verify `.env` file exists
- Check Node.js version

**Audio not working:**
